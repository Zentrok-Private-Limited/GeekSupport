My PC now runs like new, and they even gave me tips on maintaining performance. Great service, very affordable, and incredibly knowledgeable staff.`,

    text: `My HP printer suddenly stopped responding — it kept showing an offline error, and there was a constant paper jam warning even though nothing was stuck. I contacted Geek Care, and their support team quickly diagnosed the issue remotely. They cleaned the printer queue, reinstalled the driver, and updated my firmware. Within 20 minutes, my printer was working like new again! I really appreciate how they explained each step in simple language and didn’t push for unnecessary replacements.`,

    text: `My home Wi-Fi had been disconnecting randomly, and some devices couldn’t connect at all. I called Geek Care after trying everything on my own. Their technician remotely accessed my router settings, fixed IP conflicts, updated the firmware, and optimized my network channels. They even helped me reposition my router for better coverage! Since then, my connection has been super stable — no more buffering or dropouts. Highly recommend Geek Care for network issues.`,
